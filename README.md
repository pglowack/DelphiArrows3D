Delphi FireMonkey project template for interactive 3D visualisation 

This is a simple Delphi 10.1 FireMonkey 3D project that demonstrates how to add touch support for interactive mobile app. 
Just replace the content of "DummyScene" component with your 3D objects you want to visualize.
Currently "DummyScene" contains three cylinders and three cones, with corresponding material components, that make up arrows for 3D coordinate system.
